Aim: To demonstrate Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm.

Algorithm: 
Step 1: Organize all processes according to their arrival time in the ready queue. The queue structure of the ready queue is based on the FIFO structure to execute all CPU processes.

Step 2: Now, we push the first process from the ready queue to execute its task for a fixed time, allocated by each process that arrives in the queue.

Step 3: If the process cannot complete their task within defined time interval or slots because it is stopped by another process that pushes from the ready queue to execute their task due to arrival time of the next process is reached. Therefore, CPU saved the previous state of the process, which helps to resume from the point where it is interrupted. (If the burst time of the process is left, push the process end of the ready queue).

Step 4: Similarly, the scheduler selects another process from the ready queue to execute its tasks. When a process finishes its task within time slots, the process will not go for further execution because the process's burst time is finished.

Step 5: Similarly, we repeat all the steps to execute the process until the work has finished.
